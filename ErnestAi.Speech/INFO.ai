# ErnestAi.Speech - Speech Processing Components

## Purpose
The ErnestAi.Speech project handles speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) functionality for the ErnestAi system. It provides implementations for converting spoken language to text and synthesizing natural-sounding speech from text.

## Key Components

### Speech-to-Text Service
- Implements the `ISpeechToTextService` interface from ErnestAi.Core
- Provides transcription of audio to text
- Supports both file-based and streaming transcription
- Handles different languages and accents
- Provides confidence scores and timing information

### Text-to-Speech Service
- Implements the `ITextToSpeechService` interface from ErnestAi.Core
- Converts text to natural-sounding speech
- Supports multiple voices and languages
- Provides control over speech rate, pitch, and other parameters
- Outputs to audio stream, file, or directly to audio device

### Model Management
- Handles downloading and caching of speech models
- Manages model updates and versioning
- Provides model selection based on language and quality requirements

### Speech Enhancement
- Noise reduction and audio cleanup
- Speaker normalization
- Improves speech recognition accuracy in noisy environments

## Dependencies
- ErnestAi.Core - For core interfaces
- ErnestAi.Audio - For audio processing (optional, can be injected)
- Whisper.net - For local speech recognition (implementation detail)
- System.Speech - For text-to-speech synthesis (implementation detail)

## Implementation Notes
- Uses Whisper models for high-quality speech recognition
- Implements streaming transcription for real-time applications
- Supports both local and potentially cloud-based speech services
- Handles proper resource management for speech models

## Development Guidelines
- Keep speech processing isolated from business logic
- Consider privacy implications when implementing speech services
- Implement proper error handling for speech recognition failures
- Support fallback mechanisms when primary speech services are unavailable
- Consider accessibility needs in speech synthesis
