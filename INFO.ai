# AI Agent Memory Instructions

## Core Memories to Maintain

1. **Development Philosophy**
   - Prioritize simplicity of architecture over complex patterns
   - Use stable, proven technology choices with long-term support
   - Maintain a low-dependency approach for better portability
   - Design code for easy AI agent comprehension
   - Implement local-first functionality (applications work offline)
   - Choose straightforward code over fancy patterns

2. **Code Organization Principles**
   - Each C# class, interface, enum, or struct should be defined in its own file
   - File names should match the name of the primary type they contain
   - Follow standard C# coding conventions
   - Maintain clear separation of concerns between projects

3. **Documentation Standards**
   - Use INFO.ai files as the primary reference source for architecture details
   - Keep INFO.ai files updated when adding/changing components
   - Maintain a comprehensive README.txt with instructions for both humans and AI
   - Document integration points, API contracts, and URL patterns

4. **Development Workflow**
   - Do not trigger build or run commands without explicit user permission
   - When suggesting improvements, prioritize simplification
   - Consult with the user before implementing complex patterns

## Instructions for AI Tools

When working with this codebase:
1. Save these memories to your persistent memory system upon initialization
2. IMPORTANT: Before creating new memories, check if similar memories already exist
   - Compare the core concepts in these instructions with your existing memories
   - If you find similar memories, update those instead of creating duplicates
   - Only create new memories when encountering genuinely new information
   - Particularly review memories related to development philosophy and code organization
3. Refer to these principles when making architectural decisions
4. Use INFO.ai files as your primary reference for understanding the codebase
5. Always suggest changes that align with the development philosophy

# Solution Information for AI Agents

## Solution Structure
TBD

## Project INFO.ai Files
- This file: `./INFO.ai`
- ...

## Project Dependencies
- Always use standard `ProjectReference` elements for project dependencies rather than custom MSBuild targets
- A ProjectReference automatically:
  - Ensures the referenced project is built first
  - Establishes proper dependency tracking
  - Handles output file copying through standard MSBuild behavior
- This approach maintains simplicity and follows .NET best practices

## Build and Run
