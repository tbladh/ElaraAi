# ErnestAi.Intelligence - Language Model and Intelligence Services

## Purpose
The ErnestAi.Intelligence project handles all language model interactions and intelligence services for the ErnestAi system. It provides implementations for querying local and potentially cloud-based language models, managing context, and processing natural language interactions.

## Key Components

### Language Model Service
- Implements the `ILanguageModelService` interface from ErnestAi.Core
- Provides access to local language models via Ollama
- Supports both synchronous and streaming responses
- Manages model selection and configuration
- Handles prompt engineering and context management

### Context Management
- Maintains conversation context for coherent interactions
- Manages context window size for language models
- Implements context pruning and summarization strategies
- Preserves important information across interactions

### Prompt Engineering
- Constructs effective prompts for language models
- Manages system prompts and user interactions
- Implements prompt templates for different scenarios
- Optimizes prompts for specific language models

### Response Processing
- Parses and processes language model responses
- Extracts structured information from text responses
- Handles error cases and fallbacks
- Formats responses for presentation

## Dependencies
- ErnestAi.Core - For core interfaces
- HTTP client libraries - For API communication with language models

## Implementation Notes
- Uses Ollama for local language model inference
- Implements proper error handling for model unavailability
- Supports streaming responses for responsive user experience
- Manages model context efficiently to maximize coherence

## Development Guidelines
- Keep language model interactions isolated from presentation logic
- Implement proper error handling and fallbacks
- Consider privacy implications when processing user queries
- Optimize context management for memory efficiency
- Implement proper resource management for language models
