# ErnestAi.Tools

## Overview
ErnestAi.Tools provides implementations for executing tools and commands requested by the user or determined by the AI assistant. It serves as a bridge between natural language requests and actual system functionality.

## Purpose
This project is responsible for:
- Executing tools and commands
- Managing tool discovery and registration
- Validating tool parameters
- Processing tool results
- Providing a standardized tool execution framework

## Key Features
- Unified tool execution interface
- Built-in system tools (date/time, system info)
- File system operations
- Web access capabilities
- Media control functions
- Home automation integrations

## Implementation
The project implements the `IToolExecutor` interface from ErnestAi.Core, providing concrete implementations for tool execution functionality. It manages the discovery, selection, and execution of tools, handling parameter validation and error handling.

## Dependencies
- ErnestAi.Core - For core interfaces
- System libraries for file access, network operations, etc.

## Usage
This library is used by other ErnestAi components that need to execute tools or commands, such as the main conversation flow and plugin system.
