# ErnestAi.Tools - Tool Execution and Utility Services

## Purpose
The ErnestAi.Tools project provides implementations for executing tools and commands requested by the user or determined by the AI assistant. It serves as a bridge between natural language requests and actual system functionality, enabling ErnestAi to perform useful tasks beyond conversation.

## Key Components

### Tool Executor
- Implements the `IToolExecutor` interface from ErnestAi.Core
- Manages the discovery, selection, and execution of tools
- Handles parameter validation and error handling
- Returns structured results from tool execution

### Built-in Tools
- System information tools (date/time, system status)
- File system operations (read/write files, list directories)
- Web access tools (search, retrieve content)
- Media control tools (volume, playback)
- Home automation integrations (lights, thermostats)

### Tool Registry
- Maintains a registry of available tools
- Handles tool discovery and registration
- Provides tool metadata for language model context
- Manages tool permissions and security

### Parameter Processing
- Validates and processes tool parameters
- Handles type conversion and validation
- Provides helpful error messages for invalid parameters
- Supports default values and optional parameters

## Dependencies
- ErnestAi.Core - For core interfaces
- System libraries for file access, network operations, etc.

## Implementation Notes
- Implements proper security checks for sensitive operations
- Provides clear error messages for failed tool executions
- Supports both synchronous and asynchronous tool execution
- Handles proper resource management for tools

## Development Guidelines
- Keep tool implementations isolated and focused
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Consider security implications for all tools
- Document tool parameters and expected results thoroughly
- Provide examples of tool usage for language model context
